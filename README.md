Project for Code Louisville Front-End May 2021 cohort

This website is a simple resume website designed specifically to meet the requirements of the COde Louisville Front-End course.

This project is required to meet three crtieria from a list. I chose two (2) CSS criteria, and one (1) JavaScript criterion. 

The first CSS cirterion this website meets is, "Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views." I used FlexBox to organize the body of the webpage into a single column while in mobile view and two columns once the viewport is 800px or larger.

The second CSS criterion this website meets is, "A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes." While in mobile view, the navigation menu takes the form of a click-to-activate "hamburger" menu. While the viewport is 800px or larger, the navigation menu is a FlexBox navigation menu locted in the upper right corner of the page.

The JavaScript criterion this website meets is, "Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow."
